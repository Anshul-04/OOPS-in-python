# Non-Parametrized Constructor

A constructor without any arguments is called a non-parameterized constructor. 
This type of constructor is used to initialize each object with default values.

This constructor doesnâ€™t accept the arguments during object creation. Instead,
 it initializes every object with the same set of values.


'''

class Company:

    # no-argument constructor
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "PYnative"
        self.address = "ABC Street"

    # a method for printing data members
    def show(self):
        print('Name:', self.name, 'Address:', self.address)

# creating object of the class
cmp = Company()

# calling the instance method using the object
cmp.show()

'''
Note:

-> The default constructor is not present in the source py file. It is inserted into the code during compilation
   if not exists. See the below image.
-> If you implement your constructor, then the default constructor will not be added.
